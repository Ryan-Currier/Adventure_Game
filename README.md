Reflection:
            I learned a lot about problem solving, when to use data structures, and a lot about dictionarys. Also when error handling // Debugging your code I find it helpful to test it while having notepad open to actively write down what is going wrong so I can go back and fix it all in one go.

Goal:
      Get comfortable with the basics
